# Below are the color init strings for the basic file types.
# One can use codes for 256 or more colors supported by modern terminals.
# The default color codes use the capabilities of an 8 color terminal
# with some additional attributes as per the following codes:
# Attribute codes:
# 00=none 01=bold 04=underscore 05=blink 07=reverse 08=concealed
# Text color codes:
# 30=black 31=red 32=green 33=yellow 34=blue 35=magenta 36=cyan 37=white
# Background color codes:
# 40=black 41=red 42=green 43=yellow 44=blue 45=magenta 46=cyan 47=white
#NORMAL 00 # no color code at all
#FILE 00 # regular file: use no color at all
# RESET 0 # reset to "normal" color
# DIR 01;34 # directory
# LINK 01;36 # symbolic link. (If you set this to 'target' instead of a
# numerical value, the color is as for the file pointed to.)
# MULTIHARDLINK 00 # regular file with more than one link
# FIFO 40;33 # pipe
# SOCK 01;35 # socket
# DOOR 01;35 # door
# BLK 40;33;01 # block device driver
# CHR 40;33;01 # character device driver
# ORPHAN 40;31;01 # symlink to nonexistent file, or non-stat'able file ...
# MISSING 00 # ... and the files they point to
# SETUID 37;41 # file that is setuid (u+s)
# SETGID 30;43 # file that is setgid (g+s)
# CAPABILITY 30;41 # file with capability
# STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE 30;42 # dir that is sticky and other-writable (+t,o+w)
# OTHER_WRITABLE 34;42 # dir that is other-writable (o+w) and not sticky
# STICKY 37;44 # dir with the sticky bit set (+t) and not other-writable
# This is for files with execute permission:
# EXEC 01;32
# List any file extensions like '.gz' or '.tar' that you would like ls
# to colorize below. Put the extension, a space, and the color init string.
# (and any comments you want to add after a '#')
# If you use DOS-style suffixes, you may want to uncomment the following:
#.cmd 01;32 # executables (bright green)
#.exe 01;32
#.com 01;32
#.btm 01;32
#.bat 01;32
# Or if you want to colorize scripts even if they do not have the
# executable bit actually set.
#.sh 01;32
#.csh 01;32
